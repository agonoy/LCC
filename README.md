## Watchman App
This application utilizes a button. Upon release of the button, a SMS message is sent to a user defined emergency contact (telephone number) which includes a user defined message and a link to the user's most recent GPS coordinates. This app is intended for use in case of emergency, when the user is feeling unsafe. The user will be able to utilize the simple button press of the application in order to send an SOS to an emergency contact.

### Prerequisites

The files within this repository were created using Android Studio, and must be imported as a project within Android Studio. From there, you can open the project by building and running the project within an emulator of your choice.

### Known Bugs

The application crashes upon initial installation before the user grants location and SMS service use permissions. 

### Future Plans

Implement ability to have multiple users interact with each other on application
Allow for ability to plot or record gps locations over periods of time, in order to give emergency contacts an idea of a vague route that the damsal's device traveled
